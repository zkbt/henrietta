Welcome to henrietta's documentation!
=====================================

**henrietta** is a set of Python tools that we'll be using in ASTR3400 for the Fall 2018 semester. Some of these are tools that Zach and Will are writing, and some may be tools that you write as students in the class and we want to share with everyone! The code is being developed over on `github <https://github.com/zkbt/henrietta>`_. Please feel free to contribute!

These tools make *very* heavy use of the `lightkurve <http://lightkurve.keplerscience.org>`_ package led by the fine folks over at the Kepler Guest Observer office. They've developed a really swell set of tools, and it'd be worth reading through their excellent documenation and example analyses.
