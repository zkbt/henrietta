    "# Fitting a Model to Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In class we talked about two key ingredients for writing a computer recipe for optimizing a model to match data. We need a goodness-of-fit metric, and we need a way to explore the range of parameters that are out there. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Linear Least Squares\n",
    "For some classes of model fitting problems (\"linear least squares\" problems), there are some tools that can identify the best-fit parameters almost instantaneously. For example, `np.polyfit` does some magical matrix math to instantly fit a polynomial to (x,y) data. \n",
    "\n",
    "## General Fitting Problems\n",
    "You won't always have a tidy \"linear\" problem, so it's useful to understand how fitting might work more abstractly. Here are a few examples that help visualize the exploration and optimization process. "
