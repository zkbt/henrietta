You should be able to install this simply by running `pip install git+https://github.com/zkbt/henrietta.git`.

```
git clone https://github.com/zkbt/henrietta.git
cd henrietta/
pip install -e .
```
This will link the installed version of the `henrietta` package to your local repository. Changes you make to the code in the repository should be reflected in the version Python sees when it tries to `import henrietta`.
